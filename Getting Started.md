# Creating a New Project
To start a new React project named `your-app-name`, run the following:
```
npx create-react-app your-app-name
```
It will generate all the necessary files we need to get started inside a directory called `your-app-name`. Replace `your-app-name` with any arbitrary name of your choice like `todo-app`.

# Running the App

After creating your project, enter into the `your-app-name` directory and then run `npm start` to start your project. Now, you can view your application at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

# File Structure

Inside your project folder i.e, `your-app-name`(or whatever you named your project in the first step), you can see some automatically generated folders and files like:
```
README.md  node_modules  package-lock.json  package.json  public  src
```
Of these, we will be spending most of our time editing things inside `src`(where our application code lies) and inside `public` folder where our template files and assets lie.
